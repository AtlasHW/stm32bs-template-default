> The template for building applications for STM32 microcontrollers

This project is modifyed and maintained by the [Atlas Song Kai][atlas email].
The origin project is developed and maintained by the [Cortex-M team][team].

## Dependencies

To build stm32 programs using this template you'll need:

- Rust 1.31, 1.30-beta, nightly-2018-09-13 or a newer toolchain. e.g. `rustup
  default beta`

- The `cargo stm32bs` subcommand. [Installation
  instructions]`cargo install stm32bs`.

- `rust-std` components (pre-compiled `core` crate) for the ARM Cortex-M
  targets. Run:

``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi thumbv7m-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabi thumbv7em-none-eabihf thumbv8m.base-none-eabi thumbv8m.main-none-eabi thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
```

## Using this template

**NOTE**: This is the very short version that only covers building programs. For
the long version, which additionally covers flashing, running and debugging
programs, check [the embedded Rust book][book].

1. Instantiate the template.

``` console
$ cargo stm32bs --git template_path
ðŸ¤· Project Name: app
ðŸ¤· Chip Part Number (eg. stm32g071cbt6): stm32f103c8t6

ðŸ”§ Destination: /home/atlassong-k/rust/cargo-stm32bs/app ...
ðŸ”§ project-name: app ...
ðŸ”§ username: "atlasHW" (placeholder provided by cli argument)
ðŸ”§ Generating template ...
